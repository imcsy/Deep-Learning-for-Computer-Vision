## Assignment 3

- implement forward and backward functions (linear, ReLU, SVM loss, softmax loss, dropout)
- implement update rules (SGD+momentum, RMSProp, Adam)
- fully-connected network (two-layer network, multilayer network)
- implement forward and backward functions (convolutional, max-pooling, spatial batch normalization)
